# Vector Victor

Implements the below linear algebra functions using only built-in `+ - / *` operators and the `math` module. Additionally, these are written without traditional `for` or `while` loops (list comprehensions are used instead).

## How to Use This Program

* You will need to have **python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine or have access to a python&nbsp;3 interpreter. See [Python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* To run this program, save `linear_algebra.py` to your computer. Using a command-line program (such as Terminal on Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X), navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file and run the following line to use: `python3 linear_algebra.py`
