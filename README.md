# Vector Victor

Implements the below linear algebra functions using only built-in `+ - / *` operators and the `math` module. Additionally, these are written without traditional `for` or `while` loops (list comprehensions are used instead).

## How to Use These Functions

* You will need to have **python&nbsp;3** installed on your machine or have access to a python&nbsp;3 interpreter. See [Python's site](https://www.python.org/) for details.

* To use these functions in your program, save `linear_algebra.py` to your project folder. Include an import statement at the top of the files in which you intend to call the functions. (e.g., `from linear_algebra import *`.)
